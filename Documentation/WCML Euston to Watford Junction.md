# WCML Euston to Watford Junction

The West Coast Main Line is a major North-South route in the United Kingdom, running from London north to Scotland, with frequent services to Birmingham, Manchester, Preston, Glasgow and Edinburgh.

This simulation includes the line from London Euston as far north as Watford Junction, on the outskirts of London. This is one of the few sections of six track railway in the UK, with the normal fast and slow lines in addition to the "Watford DC". Long distance services use the first two sets, and the latter two are used by London Overground stopping services, as well as London Underground Bakerloo Line services.

Also included is the St Albans Abbey branch from Watford Junction, and the various lines in the Willesden area - used by London Overground services on the North London Line along with several freight services.

## Simulation

A Sunday timetable for Spring 2023 has been included. The WCML is unusual for operating as a two-track railway (ignoring the Watford DC lines) for a large amount of the weekend. As such, the fast lines only open late morning, and close again early evening, which restricts the number of long distance services.

The following services operate:
- 4tph Richmond to Stratford (LO)
- 4tph Clapham Junction to Stratford (LO)
- 4tph London Euston to Watford Junction (LO)
- 1tph Clapham Junction to Watford Junction (SN)
- 4tph Elephant & Castle to Harrow & Wealdstone (LU)
- 4tph Elephant & Castle to Stonebridge Park (LU)
- 8tph Elephant & Castle to Queen's Park (LU)
- 1tph St Albans Abbey to Watford Junction (LM)
- 1tph London Euston to Crewe (LM)
- 2tph London Euston to Birmingham New Street (LM)
- 2tph London Euston to Milton Keynes Central (LM)
- 2tph London Euston to Manchester Piccadilly (VT)
- 1tph London Euston to Liverpool Lime Street (VT)
- 1tph London Euston to Carlisle (VT)
- 2tph London Euston to Birmingham New Street (VT)

There are also several extensions to Avanti services, as well as a limited service to Chester and Holyhead.

## Operational Tips

Arrivals at London Euston all have platforms allocated (as well as arrivals at several other stations) - its recommended to keep to these. Also double check the lines which services should pass Euston Throat and Camden South Junction on.

## Development

While the timetable is complete in terms of passenger services, it currently only has one freight service included. Additionally, only the first few hours are tested, so it is possible that there are issues further through that haven't yet been found.
